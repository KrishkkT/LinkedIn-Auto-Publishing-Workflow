# LinkedIn Auto-Publishing Workflow ðŸš€

An automation system that takes a blog post from idea to live website and LinkedIn post â€” all without manual intervention.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project automates the full publishing process for blog posts using **n8n**, **Make**, and **OpenAI**.  
Once a blog is created in the dashboard, it is automatically:
1. Published to the website
2. Formatted using AI
3. Shared to LinkedIn
4. Sent via email notification

This workflow eliminates repetitive tasks, ensures consistency, and saves significant time.
